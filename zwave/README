For zwave to work the openzwave package is needed.

This can be downloaded with git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave.git

After downloading do a make and a make install in the open-zwave folder.


Also the openzwave controlpanel is needed in order to configure the zwave network.

This can be downloaded with git clone https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave-control-panel.git

Please read the README file in the open-zwave-control-panel folder for building the control panel.
